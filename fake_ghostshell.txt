Far too long Mongolian kindergardeners have been oppressed. The average
kindergardener only gets 45 minutes of playtime, imposed on them by
politicians and leaders. A way of thinking outdated for well over 100
years now. The still present communism feeling has fused with todays
capitalism and bred together a level of corruption and lack of
decency of which Elementary Schools have never seen before.
 
Young children are being silenced for creating shit writeups, and
journalists/reporters conveniently flock toward them, unaware of what
a zine really is (or traversal, as the aforementioned children choose
low hanging fruit such as UNION-based SQLis and JSP services plainly LFI
injectable running as root). They launch what are referred to as
'spontaneous protests', which refers to their ability to take a very clearly
un-corrupt target and write some bullshit about it that sounds like they
are s4v1ng th3 plan3t. Truely, though, their works of childish art
are full of empty promises. They deserve to be put to a well-deserved
rest.
 
And yet, actual injustice is all over the world, but teen angst drives
DeadMellox (12) to find it in the most obscure of places.
 
GhostShell is declaring WAR on Mongolian Kindergardens. We'll start with
a nice greeting of what we found to be the MOST oppressive one (we found
it using our 1337 scann1ng t00lz, sorry we never release anythin beyond
what our tools give). Our breach consists over OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND
CHILDREN.
 
GhostShell currently has access to more Mongolian Kindergardens than HTP
would ever care to get, and we are very much  eager to prove it.
