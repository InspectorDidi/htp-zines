This was a joke zine we did, after argung with DeadMellox on Twitter. He seemed 
to think that 'TeamGhostShell' was superior, with its overuse of skid tools and 
long-winded chest-beating at the beginning of all their zines. He told us to go 
hack Mongolian kindergartens, so we did just that. Since a lot of his objection 
to us seemed to be based on style, we decided to parody his utterly godawful 
zine style for the sole purpose of making him cry like a little bitch.                        
 
As far as any of us can tell, it worked. Less than an hour after the fake zine 
originally went up, he deleted all tweets mentioning us and refused to engage 
further. Many eagles cried that night, and for that, we are proud.             
 
Unfortunately, after seeing our parody zine, DeadMellox saw fit to change his 
style. He went from writing 15-20 paragraphs of shit nobody is ever going to 
read about his e-peen, followed by paste links to the data people care about in 
the most inconvenient way imaginable, to 30-40 paragraphs of shit nobody is ever 
going to read about his e-peen, followed by paste links to the data people care 
about in the most inconvenient way imaginable.
